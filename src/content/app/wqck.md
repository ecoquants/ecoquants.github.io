title: Check Water Quality
---

This idea was initiated by environmental attorney Jesse Swanhuyser, who sought to make it easier for potential point source pollutors to comply with California state water quality monitoring requirements, including 4 samples over the 6 month rainy season. The first major rain is the most important to capture, and subsequent sampling is ideally spaced out in time. 

We're working on developing a subscription and notification system such that 10-day precipitation forecasts are analyzed based on site-specific climatologies and reporting histories.
