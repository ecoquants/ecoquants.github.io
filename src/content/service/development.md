We rapidly develop interactive data driven web applications, particularly those with complexity in space, time and taxa. We employ technologies such as Shiny (R) and Jupyter (Python), as well as Google App and Earth Engines. We can facilitate hosting these applications in the cloud, and scale resources as needed.
