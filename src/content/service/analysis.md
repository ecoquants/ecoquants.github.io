Usually most of the work in modeling is at the data preparation and interpretation stages, ie before and after modeling. I'm an advocate of efficient data ingestion (estimated [50-80%spent on collection and preparation of data](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0)), the iterative process of [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) and closing the gap between the starting with a question and sharing analytical results online and interactively to any audience.
