The website EcoQuants is alive and ticking! Here's what I'm using in order to host it for free and still contain dynamic content:

- [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com): hosting for free, and files versioned using git
- [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown): R package to use the fast Hugo templating engine
- [hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog](https://github.com/bbest/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog): latest Bootstrap applied to Hugo template
- [boostrap4-carousel](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/): baked this into the index page

## htmlwidgets

Power of d3 JS ported to single R functions to provide interactive experience from static web files.

## hugo

Included:
- Google Analytics for website visitor tracking
- Disqus for commenting

TODO:
- forms for contact
- search 

... more on this later...
