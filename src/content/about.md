At EcoQuants, we see the world as a complex place. Sustainable management of our natural resources and personal health require a data-driven approach.

The EcoQuants logo is fashioned around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensō"><strong>ensō</strong></a>, a symbol in Zen calligraphy representing the striving towards unity (a circle) and embrace of imperfection (incomplete circle). At EcoQuants we similarly seek to model complex systems in a holistic manner, and still work with inevitable uncertainty. A 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst"><strong>quant</strong></a> is a quantitative analyst who applies mathematical and statistical techniques to modeling systems, typically in the financial world. We're similarly applying these techniques to ecological problems, hence EcoQuants. (And do you see the "Q" in the enso logo?)

## Status

EcoQuants is currently a single-member Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). So I use the royal "we" to refer to myself, Ben Best. But that's just for the moment. We plan to expand in the future and will be hiring as contracts exceed my individual capacity.

I am an environmental data scientist with a strong background in marine spatial ecology. I have lectured extensively at UC Santa Barbara's [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/). I was the senior analyst for the [Ocean Health Index](http://ohi-science.org), a research project housed at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). I recently completed a PhD at Duke University in the [Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab](http://mgel.env.duke.edu). I worked on [Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools](http://mgel.env.duke.edu/mget), [OBIS-SEAMAP](http://seamap.env.duke.edu/) marine animal observation geoportal, [Census of Marine Life Map & Viz](http://comlmaps.org/) and [predictive distribution modeling of cetaceans](http://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/Duke-EC-GOM-2015/).
